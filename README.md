# Socket Communication (TCP & UDP)

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of both **TCP** and **UDP** server-client communication in Python. It supports basic messaging between clients and allows clients to join, send messages, and exit, with real-time broadcasting to all connected clients.

## Features
- **TCP Communication**:
  - Client connects to the server using TCP, sends and receives messages.
  - Server accepts clients, handles disconnections, and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
  
- **UDP Communication**:
  - Client connects to the server using UDP, sends and receives messages.
  - Server handles clients and broadcasts messages to all clients.
